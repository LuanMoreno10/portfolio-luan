                <p>I’m Luan Moreno, a recent Computer Engineering graduate. I have a strong interest in software development, networks, security, and systems administration, where I enjoy exploring creative and practical solutions.
Beyond technology, I’m naturally curious and always eager to learn. In my free time, I enjoy travelling, discovering new places and cultures, playing sports, and spending time with friends and family – activities that help me grow both personally and professionally.
My goal is to continue developing my skills, contribute to innovative projects, and turn ideas into solutions that create a real impact in everyday life.</p>
